FIN7, a notorious cybercriminal group, is actively targeting retail and hospitality sectors in its latest campaign. 
The group leveraged Carbanak malware, commonly used for financial data theft. Initial access was gained by exploiting 
vulnerabilities in POS systems. Spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments were used as the primary delivery vector. 
The malware was observed communicating with IP address 192.0.2.10 and domain pos-security-update.com.
